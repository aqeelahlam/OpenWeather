This document will describe the test case selection strategy used to select the test cases for our weatherforcast.py program.
The aim of the test case selection strategy (tcss) is to maximise statement coverage with the minimum number of tests.
A series of white box test strategies will be implemented with the help of a control flow graph (cfg) to achieve this.
The cfg is shown below.


## What does it mean by test strategy? what are whit box test strategies? dont we just select the tests which have the highest coverage?
isnt that the strategy? So is our strategy to just select the test cases with the highest coverage.
